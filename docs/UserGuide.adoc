== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a flashcard application that helps users store and organise their learning material. With an easy to use interface and convenient content sharing functionality, *Know-It-All* is designed to help students perform rote learning more efficiently. From cramming in between lessons to focused study, the interactive test session boosts the effectiveness of repetition and recall for memorisation. *Know-It-All* targets medicine students as their studies involve a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.

//end::folderoperations[]

=== Card Operations
Commands listed in this section affect the flashcards within a single folder.

[NOTE]
The commands in this section can only be executed when you are within a folder. The commands are also not valid inside a test or report session. You can easily verify you are inside a folder with the status bar at the bottom, which should display: +
 +
image:StatusBarInFolder.png[width ="200"]

// tag::add[]
==== Adding a flashcard : `add`

Adds a flashcard to the current folder. *Know-It-All* supports 2 types of flashcards: **Single answer cards** and **MCQ** cards.

* Each question, answer, incorrect option and hint must be 256 characters or less (including spaces).
* If the card to be added has the same question and answer as an existing card, the card to be added will be considered a duplicate card, and the add attempt will be invalid.
* A card can have at most 1 hint (including 0).
* A card can have at most 3 incorrect options to denote an MCQ card.
* A card with 0 incorrect options will automatically be denoted as a Single answer card.
* If the content of a card exceeds the length of the card, you can scroll/click and drag to see the rest of the content.
====

Examples:

* `add q/Hello? a/World`
* `add q/The cat ___ on the mat a/sat h/poetry`
* `add q/What is the powerhouse of the cell? a/mitochondria i/cell wall i/nucleus h/biology`

**Adding Fill-In-The-Blanks style card** `Coming in v2.0`

Format: `sort`
//end::sortcommand[]

==== Search by keywords : `search`

Within a folder, searches for flashcards inside the current folder using keywords in flashcard questions.

Format: `search KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

==== List flashcards : `list`

Display a list of the flashcards in the current folder, where only questions can be seen, answers are hidden.

Format: `list`

====
* This command is implicitly invoked upon entering a folder, and can be used to reset the view after search or sort.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the cards in a particular card folder to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed.

Format: `undo`

====
* This command is performed with respect to the present folder you are in. For example, if you perform an `add` operation in folder A and enter folder B, invoking the `undo` command will undo the previous _undoable_ command performed in folder B and not the aforementioned `add` operation.
====

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: commands that modify a card folder's content (`add`, `delete` and `edit`).
====

[NOTE]
At the end of a successful test session, scores are final and you will not be able to perform an `undo` to
restore the previous states before the test session.

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command performed in a folder.

Format: `redo`

====
* As with the `undo` command, this command is performed with respect to the present folder you are in. For example, if you perform an `undo` operation in folder A and enter folder B, invoking the `redo` command will redo the previous `undo` command performed in folder B and not the one in folder A.
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]


//tag::advancedoperations[]

==== Export flashcards : `export`
Exporting flashcards is a great way to start sharing your flashcards with others.

The export command creates a csv file containing the flashcards from the specified folder in your project root directory.


Format: `export FOLDER_INDEX [MORE_INDEXES]`

[NOTE]
The export command creates the new csv file in your project root directory.
i.e The directory where your .jar file is located. +
The import command imports csv files located in the same directory as well.

image::project_root_dir.png[width ="800"]

[NOTE]
The current version does not support the importing and exporting of files outside of this directory

====
* You should key in indices corresponding to the folder index
* Negative numbers are not allowed
====

Examples:

* `export 1 2 3` +
exports the first, second and third cardfolder in your home directory.
Suppose that the first, second and third cardfolder corresponds to the card folder names : +
Blood +
Circulatory System +
Cardiovascular +
Then the following files Blood.csv, Circulatory System.csv and Cardiovascular.csv
will be created in the project root directory.

==== Import flashcards : `import`
Besides being able to import flashcards exported by others, the import command provies a faster way of
creating multiple flashcards.

You type your flashcards out on excel and later save it in your project root directory, allowing you
to import it over to your application.


NOTE: The csv file imported should follow the format described below

====
* The first row of the csv file should have the following headers:
+
Question, Answer, Hints, Option, Option, Option.
* Question and Answer are mandatory fields, and should not be left blank.
* Hints can take 0 or 1 values only.
* For MCQ cards, The csv file accepts up to 3 incorrect options per flashcard.
====

.Sample format for csv file
image::Blood.png[width = "800"]

Format: `import FILENAME`

NOTE: unlike the export command the importing of multiple csv files
is not supported in *Know-It-All*. +
Filename imported is case insensitive.

Examples:

* `import Blood.csv` +
Imports blood csv file into *Know-It-All*. A new Blood cardfolder should be present in the home
directory after execution of this command.
// end::advancedoperations[]


//tag::testoperations[]
=== Test Operations
After memorising the content of the flashcards, it is helpful to test how much information have been internalised and retained in a timed setting. The following commands show just how this can be done with the <<testsession, Test Session>> functionality of *Know-It-All*.

[NOTE]
At the end of a successful test session, scores are final and you will not be able to perform an `undo` to restore the
previous states before the test session.

==== Test flashcards in a folder : `test`

You will enter a test session, where the display area enters a fullscreen and you will be presented flashcard
questions and hints (if any) one by one. You should see a screen like the figure below.

.A successful test command will display a test session page
image::startTestSessionPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Format: `test`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid when inside the folder to be tested and is not already inside a test session.

[NOTE]
This command is invalid if the current folder is empty as there will be no flashcards to test.

====
* Hints will be presented along with the questions.
* When presented with a question in a test session, you can either input an attempt or enter the command to reveal the
answer.
* For **MCQ cards**, the ordering of options will be randomized each time the flashcard is tested.
* Internally, flashcards in a folder are queued to be displayed one by one in the order of lowest existing score to highest existing score.
* The next flashcard will only be presented when the next command is carried out.
====


Examples:

* `test`

**Hint toggle on / off feature** `Coming in v2.0`

If you are familiar with the content and feeling confident,
simply toggle off hints during the test session. You can do it by specifying ‘-nohint’ at the end of the
test command. Hint will not be displayed along with the question when the card is presented.

Format: `test [-nohint]`

**Timer feature** `Coming in v2.0`

If you are preparing for an exam that will require you to recall information quickly within the limited time given,
this timer feature is just right for you! You will be given only 20 seconds to answer each question. If the 20 seconds is up before the question is answered, this attempt will be marked as wrong.

Format: `test [-timer]`

==== Keying in answer to a flashcard: `ans`

To reinforce learning and provide a more engaging experience with *Know-It-All*, you can input an answer for the
currently displayed flashcard question. *Know-It-All* compares your attempt with the correct answer for that flashcard and
tells you if you are right or wrong.

If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is *correct*, you will see the following page.

.Correct Answer page
image::CorrectAnswerPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +

If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is *wrong*, you will see the following page.

.Wrong Answer page
image::WrongAnswerPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Format: `ans ANSWER`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being
displayed in an active test session.

====
* Answer matching is case insensitive.
* Answering a flashcard will increase the total number of attempts. If your answer is correct, this action will also
increase the number of correct attempts.
* To answer **MCQ cards**, enter the number of the option that you think is correct, rather than the option itself. +
E.g. `ans 1` rather than `ans myanswer`
====

Examples:

* `ans Mitochondrion` +
in response to the card question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?

* `ans 2` +
in response to the card displayed below, choosing option 2 will give the right answer as the correct answer is
'Pigs'.

.Answering an MCQ card
image::AnsweringMcqCard.png[width="500"]
//end::testoperations[]
==== Reveal answer to a flashcard : `reveal`
If you have no clue what the answer is, this command immediately reveals the correct answer, as seen in the figure
below. You will not need attempt any answer before being presented the correct answer.

.Revealed Answer page
image::RevealAnswerPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Format: `reveal`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being displayed in an active test session.

====
* This is equivalent to a wrong answer attempted, so there is no addition to the correct attempts of this card.
====

==== Go to next flashcard : `next`

You will be presented with the next lowest scoring flashcard in this current test session. Upon a successful next
command, you should see a similar page below.

.Next card question displayed upon a successful next command
image::NextCommandPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Format: `next`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question and answer is currently being displayed (has already done answering the question or revealed the answer) in an active test session. In other words, a flashcard cannot be skipped.

====
* If all cards have already been tested, a next command will be equivalent to an end command, ending the current test
 session.
* There is no backtracking in the current session so there is no `prev` command.
====

[[EndCommand]]
==== End the current test session : `end`

Quits the current test session and you will be back inside the card folder. You should see a page like below.

.A successful end command brings you back to inside the folder
image::EndCommandPage.png[width="500"]

{empty} +
Format: `end`

[NOTE]
For the final <<testscore, test score>> to be recorded, you must have attempted at least 1/4 of cards in the
 card folder. If there are less than 4 cards, any number of cards attempted will be recorded.

//tag::reportoperations[]
=== Report Operations
After testing, you can track how you scored against previous attempts using our report feature. Because test
sessions are run for cards in a folder, the <<testscore, test scores>> are tracked per folder.

==== Display a test score report : `report`

Displays a full-screen <<testscore, test score>> report for the current folder.
The report comprises a graph showing a maximum of the last 10 <<testscore, test scores>>,
the latest score change, and a maximum of 3 lowest individual scoring cards and their individual <<cardscore, card scores>>.
An example is shown below:

.Report display
image::ReportDisplay.png[width="790"]

[TIP]
The report display is currently best viewed with the window in full screen. Otherwise, you may need to use the horizontal and vertical
scroll bars to view the graph and questions. Hang tight, a display that changes in size is coming in v2.0!

**Displays response time for each card** `Coming in v2.0`

With the timer feature coming in v2.0, we are also able to track the time taken to provide the correct response to the
 question. This provides yet another metric, in addition to correctness, to judge your understanding of the topic.


Format: `report`

[NOTE]
This command is only valid inside a folder.

====
* There must be at least two test attempts for the line graph to be drawn.
====
==== End the current report session : `end`

Quits the current report session.

Format: `end`

[NOTE]
This command is only valid inside a report display.

//end::reportoperations[]


=== Global operations
These commands are valid from anywhere in the application.

==== Viewing help : `help`

Opens the User Guide in a new window.

Format: `help`

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`
