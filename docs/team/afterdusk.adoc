== About the Project

Know-It-All is a flashcard application borne from CS2103T, a software engineering course spanning 13 weeks. We were tasked to take an existing addressbook application and either enhance it or morph it into a different product. After 4 developmental milestones, the result is Know-It-All, a digital flashcard solution that helps users store and organise their learning material. With an easy to use interface and convenient sharing functionality, Know-It-All iss designed to help students perform rote learning more efficiently. From cramming in between lessons to focused study, the interactive test session boosts the effectiveness of repetition and recall for memorisation.

My role in the project was to implement a folder system, so that users could group together multiple sets of flashcards. Apart from writing code, I maintained the User Guide, Developer Guide and project GitHub repository. Most importantly, I synergised with my team members to work productively and help everyone achieve their goals.

In this document, the following style elements from the respective documentation are present:

`test`: Command to be executed or a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of Contributions
*Major Enhancement*: I added the ability to have *flashcard folders*

* What it does: allows the user to create folders that store separate sets of flashcards. Folders can be renamed and deleted.
* Justification: This feature allows the user to logically group flashcards of the same topic together, separate from flashcards of other topics. This significantly improves the product as it enables better organisation, which is crucial for efficiency and ease of use.
* Highlights: The enhancement affected all components extensively. For some components, the architecture had to be redesigned, and the multiple options to do so had to be carefully considered and assessed. The implementation was also challenging due to the tightly coupled nature of classes within each component, and the non-trivial changes to architecture required both a deep and broad understanding of how every component worked.

** The tests I wrote increased coverage from 80% to 84% (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/104[#104], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/177[#177])

*Other Contributions*:

* Project Management:
** Created GitHub organisation and team repository, issue labels, milestones and https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/projects/1[project board]
** Managed and tagged milestones `v1.1` to `v1.2`

* Documentation:
** User Guide:
*** Introduced an About section (later renamed to How To Use this Guide) and populated the Command Summary and Glossary sections. Also revised the document format be more consistent (Pull request https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/90[#90])

** Developer Guide:
*** Wrote user stories to set project requirements, which were eventually ported over to GitHub issues for project management (Pull request https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/53[#53])
*** Contributed to use cases and manual testing (Pull request https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/104[#104], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/180[#180])

* Community:
** Performed the initial refactoring of code to flashcard context (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/37[#37])
** Reviewed over 20 pull requests, spotting potential errors and making suggestions (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/128[#128], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/178[#178])
** Made bug reports to notify teammates of bugs related to their components (Issues https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/issues/118[#118], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/issues/122[#122], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/issues/136[#136], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/issues/169[#169]) and addressed/assigned bug reports from external testers
** Integrated a GitHub plugin (Netlify) to the team repo
