<p>Know-It-All is a flashcard application that helps students manage, store, and use flash cards effectively. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
My major roles included the report feature and ability to record score. To see directly what code I contributed, a <a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=dlqs">summary</a> provided by RepoSense is available here.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added the <strong>ability to generate test scoring report for card folder</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: Records the number of questions correctly answered after a test session, called the test score, and generates a report for that folder that shows the change in (past) test scores.
There is also a line showing percentage change in test score as well as the lowest individual scoring cards in the current folder.
 Test scores are only recorded if at least 1/4 of the questions in the folder are attempted. An example is shown below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/ReportDisplay.png" alt="ReportDisplay" width="790"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can see the outcome of the spaced-repetition technique employed by Know-It-All. They are able to track their average score over time, per folder, so that
they are able tell which folders they score well and not so well for. This lets them know which folder they need to practice more on.
 Also, the minimum number of questions required to be answered is so that the user do not get their accidental test attempts recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement has a graph showing a maximum of the 10 test session scores. The color of the folder score change
also changes based on whether it was a positive, same or negative change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to sort by scoring performance</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows the user to sort the cards by scoring performance. Other features can make use of this feature by using any appropriate comparator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This lets the user see which cards they scored the lowest on, so that they know which cards require more practice.
This feature also improves the product significantly because many other features can be built on top of this one, e.g. the test session, which puts the lowest scoring cards in front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing list. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changing the way cards are naturally ordered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Added State to Model Component&#8217;s to represent user&#8217;s "location" in the application. This removes edge cases of commands being executed illegally, i.e. where they otherwise shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a score attribute that allows the application to track the number of correct and incorrect attempts for individual cards.</p>

<p>Besides the aforementioned new features for users, I also refactored internal code which affects how other developers should contribute

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The report feature is meant to provide the user with the ability to look back and compare their test score from
previous test sessions. It makes use of Java FXML features to display scores in a user-friendly manner. The following
methods are used to enter or exit the report display:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Model#enterReportDisplay()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Enters the report display for this folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#exitReportDisplay()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Exits the report display back into the folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a screenshot of how it looks:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/ReportDisplay.png" alt="ReportDisplay" width="800"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the report display is rendered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1. The user is in a folder and wishes to see a report by executing <code>report</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 2. A <code>ReportCommand</code> is created and executed by <code>LogicManager</code>. <code>Model#enterReportDisplay()</code> is called, which prepares
the model for report by sorting the cards by lowest scores first. The state is also checked to make sure the user is in
a folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 3. A <code>CommandResult</code> with type <code>ENTERED_REPORT</code> is returned by the <code>ReportCommand</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is a sequence diagram, summarizing the above operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Sequence Diagram for Report Command</div>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/ReportCommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ReportCommandSequenceDiagram" width="800"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 4. The <code>CommandResult</code> is passed to UI, which now has to render the new screen. It does so by getting the current
 <code>CardFolder</code> from Model, then instantiating a <code>ReportDisplay</code> with it. <code>ReportDisplay</code> prepares several elements for
 display by Java FXML, split by their content:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ReportDisplay#displayTitle()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Displays title and how many test scores were recorded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ReportDisplay#displayGraph()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Takes maximum of last 10 test scores from <code>CardFolder</code>, and
adds them as points on the Java FXML <code>AreaChart</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ReportDisplay#displayQuestions()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Displays maximum of 3 questions from <code>CardFolder</code> which have lowest the
individual <a href="#cardscore">card scores</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ReportDisplay#displayTagline()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Calculates change in test score from last and second last test session
(if available) and formats it in a user-friendly manner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 5. The <code>ReportDisplay</code> is rendered by <code>fullScreenPlaceholder</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Becomes very unsafe as even a typo would mean entering a state that other parts of the application would not understand.
e.g. Setting state to "Folder" instead of "folder".</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use boolean flags</p>
