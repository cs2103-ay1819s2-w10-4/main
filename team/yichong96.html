<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hello ! I am Yi Chong, a year 2 Computer Science student. I have worked on a few projects in the past, of which I have
developed an android application and built a machine learning model to classify e-commerce products. My current areas of interest
include Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering. This project portfolio serves to document my contributions
to Know-It-All; including the code base, developer and user guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="overview"><a class="link" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The motivation behind this project came from a problem faced by Wei Jie, a medical student and friend of my group mate.
Wei Jie is an avid user of flashcards for study. However, the trouble of carrying physical flashcards and
the sheer amount of content recorded on flashcards has caused major inconveniences to Wei Jie.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of our Software Engineering project, we had the option to either enhance the existing address book software or
morph it into another product. As such, our team decided to morph the existing product into a flashcard application for
students like Wei Jie, who prefer flashcards as a study method but find using physical flashcards a major pain point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This enhanced application helps students organize their digital flashcards neatly.
The application also comes with a test feature; allowing users to test themselves on the flashcards
created, a report feature; allowing them to view their performance for each folder and a import and
export feature; which allows for the sharing of flashcards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to design and write the codes for the import and export features. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.</p>

<p><code>command</code>: A monospace font has two meanings. For the user guide, it represents a command
that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application. In the Developer guide,
it can represent methods, variables or classes found within the Java files in addition to command line
input by the user.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section contains a summary of my contributions to the project;
mainly the code and documentation for the import and export feature as well as contributions to the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to import/export existing or new flashcards</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The import command allows users to import flashcards from a a .csv file while the export command
allows users to export flashcards as a .csv file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: These two complementary features improve the product significantly because users can now share their flashcards with others,
saving time taken to create similar flashcards for the other user.
Also, being able to import flashcards from a csv file provides users with a quicker alternative to create large numbers of flashcards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: Although not technically challenging, there were many considerations that went into the design of the import/export feature. One of them was deciding
the formatting of csv files. whether a user should be able to export multiple card folders into a single csv. Also, since commas
were used within each card field as well, there was a need to ensure that the comma separated values are actually not
part of the "commas" within the card field itself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Import and Export feature is facilitated by the Logic and model components, together
with the addition of 3 new classes inside the csvmanager package defined under
the storage package.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="logic" class="discrete">Logic</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to how the current commands are implemented, where each specific command inherits from the abstract
class command, the Import and Export command likewise inherit from the command class.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="model" class="discrete">Model</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The model component supports the addition of a new object attribute <code>CsvManager</code>, that carries out the read and
write logic of cards to external files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, model implements two new methods, <code>Model#importCardFolders</code> and <code>Model#exportCardFolders</code>.
These two methods further call the CsvManager API to read and write card folders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Model also implements <code>Model#setTestCsvPath</code> and the <code>Model#getDefaultPath</code> which are only used during testing.</p>
</div>
<h5 id="csvmanager-package" class="discrete">csvmanager package:</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The csvmanager package contains all classes dealing with the reading and writing of card folders into and out to
the model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classes include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>CsvManager</code> - Main class responsible for the writing and reading of .csv files during the import and export of files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CsvFile</code> - Wrapper class for file name input by user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CsvCommands</code> interface - API for import/export method in CsvManager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CsvUtils</code> - Utility class containing the default path and test paths used by the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main logic for the import / export command is carried out inside the CsvManager class specified by it&#8217;s
API <code>CsvManager#writeFoldersToCsv</code> and <code>CsvManager#readFoldersToCsv</code>.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>User wants to export folders Human Anatomy and Nervous System.
Suppose that these two folders index as shown on the main application screen is 1 and 3 respectively.
The user types <code>export 1 3</code></p>

<li>
<p>The Export command parser extracts the indices, stores the indices into a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> and
<code>ExportCommand</code> object, which keeps track of the indices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Export command calls executes, resulting in a call to the  <code>Model#exportCardFolders</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Model#exportCardFolders</code> method checks that all card folders specified by user exists within the model.
With reference to the diagram below, we can see that the indices specified by the user (1 and 3) corresponds to the
(i - 1) th indexes of the list of card folders in the model,
where 1 &lt; i &#8656; no.of card folders in model.<br>

<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice)</strong>: Implement read and write card folders in StorageManager class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: The most intuitive solution,
since Storage involves read and write logic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Either Logic and Model will be more coupled with storage. Storage also has more than one responsibility now.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>:Implement read/write and other logic in another class. (Current)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Separate responsibilities of both Storage and Model. Model class can focus on the representation of the in-memory card folders
and Storage class can focus on managing the internal card folder data (.json files)</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: More code to write. Storage class could possibly call the relevant API&#8217;s

<p>Pros: Saves user trouble of calling multiple import for files.<br>
Each card folder is separated by a new line.</p>

<p>Cons: Not a .csv file anymore. First line header would now specify cardfolder name before card headers,
